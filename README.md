# Wicked Free Wi-Fi: Analyzing Boston's Free Wireless Network
Wicked Free Wi-Fi is a program that provides free wireless internet access to residents and visitors in certain cities and towns in Massachusetts, United States. This project analyzes two datasets - [WICKED FREE WI-FI DAILY CONNECTIONS](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/wicked-free-wi-fi-daily-connections) and [WICKED FREE WIFI LOCATIONS](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/wicked-free-wifi-locations). The first dataset is used to identify trends and patterns in the number of daily connections to Wicked Free Wifi using Python's pandas library. The second dataset is used to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau to make it easier for people to find Wi-Fi hotspots in their area.

## Analysis In Python: 
his project is a data analysis of daily connections to the Wicked Free Wi-Fi network in Boston, Massachusetts from 2014 to 2016. The goal is to explore the data, clean and preprocess it, and perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. 

### Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, chart_studio

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
First I imported the dataset using pandas and stored it in a dataframe named df. Then I checked the data types of each column, the number of missing values, and the number of duplicated rows. I found that there were no missing or duplicated values, and I converted the date column to a datetime format using the pd.to_datetime() function. I also grouped the data by date using the groupby() to get a better understanding of the trends in connection data over time. 

### Conclusion:
