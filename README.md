#Wicked Free Wi-Fi: Analyzing Boston's Free Wireless Network
Wicked Free Wi-Fi is a program that provides free wireless internet access to residents and visitors in certain cities and towns in Massachusetts, United States. This project analyzes two datasets - ![WICKED FREE WI-FI DAILY CONNECTIONS](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/wicked-free-wi-fi-daily-connections)
 and WICKED FREE WIFI LOCATIONS. The first dataset is used to identify trends and patterns in the number of daily connections to Wicked Free Wifi using Python's pandas library. The second dataset is used to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau to make it easier for people to find Wi-Fi hotspots in their area.
